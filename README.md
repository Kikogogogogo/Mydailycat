# My daily cat
# Life needs cat! Try to press the button to generate your daily cat and learn a fact about cat! Try to explore please. Feel free to leave a rating for the facts and images! We would really appreciate them!!

**1.Problem domain:**
We have several tentative ideas. Firstly we want to complete a recipe search project
since we always need to worry about what to eat daily. After discussion, we decide to 
do a virtual cat generating project which is more accessible.

**2.About our application:**
Cat is too adorable to be missed! When we are far from our pets or tired during work,
furry friends might be best snack! Our aim is to build up an app that can generate random
picture and random facts about cat. Plus, a third use case is to rate the fact so that
our team can improve the contents for users. In the future we might consider trying to store
the facts and pictures given by users, and show comments from other users, like an app
where cat lover can discuss anything about cat!
